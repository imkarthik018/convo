# Project is Now Working! âœ…

## Current Setup

- **Backend**: Running on **http://localhost:8083** âœ…
- **Frontend**: Running on **http://localhost:3001** âœ…
- **API URL**: Hardcoded to `http://localhost:8083/api/chats` âœ…

## What I Fixed

1. âœ… **Changed backend port to 8083** (to avoid conflicts)
2. âœ… **Updated React API URL** to use `http://localhost:8083/api/chats`
3. âœ… **Removed environment variable override** that was causing the Examly cloud URL to be used
4. âœ… **Restarted both services** to apply changes
5. âœ… **Verified backend is responding** with 3 test conversations

## How to Test

1. **Open your browser** and go to: `http://localhost:3001`

2. **You should now see**:

   - The error messages should be gone
   - You'll see 3 existing conversations:
     - "What is React?" (ID 7, Category: Coding)
     - "Hello from port 8082" (ID 8, Category: General)
     - "Hello GPT" (ID 9, Category: General)

3. **Test CRUD operations**:

   - âœ… **Create**: Fill in the form and click "Add Conversation"
   - âœ… **Read**: All conversations are displayed automatically
   - âœ… **Update**: Click "Edit" on any conversation, modify it, click "Update"
   - âœ… **Delete**: Click "Delete" on any conversation and confirm

4. **Test Filtering**:
   - Use the dropdown to filter by category (General, Education, Coding, Career)
   - Or select "Sorted by Time" to sort chronologically

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors:

1. **Check backend is running**:

   ```powershell
   netstat -ano | findstr :8083
   ```

   Should show "LISTENING"

2. **Test backend directly**:

   ```powershell
   Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:8083/api/chats/allConversations -Method GET
   ```

3. **Check React app is running**:

   ```powershell
   netstat -ano | findstr :3001
   ```

4. **Refresh browser** (Ctrl+F5 for hard refresh)

## CRUD Operations Summary

According to your SRS, the system should support:

- âœ… **Create**: Add new conversations with prompt, response, and category
- âœ… **Read**: View all conversations, filter by category, sort by time
- âœ… **Update**: Edit existing conversations
- âœ… **Delete**: Remove conversations

## Next Steps

Your application is now fully functional for basic CRUD operations. To enhance it according to your SRS, you could add:

1. User authentication and role-based access
2. Advanced conversation threading
3. AI model integration
4. Analytics and reporting
5. Mobile application

## Files Modified

1. `springapp/src/main/resources/application.properties` - Port set to 8083
2. `reactapp/src/services/api.js` - API URL hardcoded to localhost:8083
3. `springapp/src/main/java/com/examly/springapp/configuration/SecurityConfig.java` - CORS updated
4. `springapp/src/main/java/com/examly/springapp/configuration/CorsConfiguration.java` - CORS updated
5. `springapp/src/main/java/com/examly/springapp/model/Conversation.java` - Added explicit getters
