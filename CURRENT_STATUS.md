# Current System Status

## 🔍 What's Actually Running

Both **Backend** and **Frontend** are running in the background!

### Services Currently Active:

✅ **Backend (Spring Boot)**

- **Status**: Running
- **Port**: 8083
- **Process ID**: 10596
- **Started**: Earlier in our session
- **How**: Started as background job

✅ **Frontend (React)**

- **Status**: Running
- **Port**: 3001
- **Process ID**: 14304
- **Started**: Earlier in our session
- **How**: Started as background job

## 📝 Why This Happened

When we were troubleshooting the project connection issues, I ran these commands to start both services:

```powershell
# This started the backend in the background
cd springapp
Start-Job -ScriptBlock { cd C:\Users\vjkar\OneDrive\Desktop\convo\springapp; mvn spring-boot:run }

# This started the frontend normally
cd reactapp
npm start
```

These processes started in the background and are still running!

## 🛑 How to Stop Everything

If you want to stop these services:

### Stop Frontend:

```powershell
taskkill /F /PID 14304
```

### Stop Backend:

```powershell
taskkill /F /PID 10596
```

### Stop All at Once:

```powershell
taskkill /F /PID 14304
taskkill /F /PID 10596
```

---

## ✅ Verify They're Working

### Test Backend:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:8083/api/chats/allConversations -Method GET
```

### Check Frontend:

Open browser: http://localhost:3001

---

## 🎯 What This Means

Your React app works because:

1. ✅ **Backend is already running** in the background (PID 10596)
2. ✅ **Frontend is already running** in the background (PID 14304)
3. ✅ Both services started earlier and never stopped
4. ✅ They're communicating successfully on ports 8083 and 3001

This is actually good! It means everything is working as expected.

## 🔄 Restart Services

If you want to restart everything properly:

### Stop Everything:

```powershell
# Find all Java and Node processes
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -eq 'java'} | Stop-Process -Force
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -eq 'node'} | Stop-Process -Force
```

### Start Fresh:

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**

```powershell
cd springapp
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**

```powershell
cd reactapp
npm start
```

---

## 📊 Summary

- **Current Status**: Both services running in background
- **You didn't need to start them** because they were already running
- **Everything is working** - that's why your React app can connect to the backend
- **To restart**: Stop the current processes and start them manually

**This is actually normal behavior for background services!**
