Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
ChatGPT Conversation Management System
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this SRS document is to define the comprehensive requirements for the ChatGPT
Conversation Management System. This system will facilitate intelligent conversation organization,
advanced AI interaction capabilities, and comprehensive dialogue management for users engaging with
ChatGPT while enabling administrators, developers, and researchers to handle conversation analytics,
model training, and user experience optimization. The system provides robust tools for conversation
threading, context management, prompt engineering, and AI response analysis while ensuring seamless
integration with OpenAI services and comprehensive user experience management.
1.2 Scope
The system enables AI administrators to manage comprehensive conversation operations, dialogue
processing workflows, and user interaction analytics while tracking conversation patterns and maintaining
AI service quality standards. It supports administrators, AI researchers, prompt engineers, and users in
managing conversations, optimizing AI interactions, and ensuring compliance with AI usage policies
through role-based access control. The system will expose secured REST APIs, a web-based frontend with
authentication, mobile applications, and comprehensive CRUD operations. Key functionalities include:
AI administrator and user authentication system
Role-based access control (Admin, AI Researcher, Prompt Engineer, Premium User, Free User)
Complete CRUD operations for conversation and prompt management
Advanced conversation threading and context preservation
Real-time AI response optimization and analysis
Multi-model AI integration and comparison features
Conversation analytics and pattern recognition
Prompt library management and sharing system
Dashboard interfaces for different user roles
Notification system for conversation insights and AI updates
Reporting and analytics for conversation effectiveness and user engagement
AI safety monitoring and content moderation system
Security features including data validation and audit logging
Comprehensive search and filtering capabilities across conversations
Mobile application for seamless AI interaction and conversation management
Integration with OpenAI APIs and other AI service providers
